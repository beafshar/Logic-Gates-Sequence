    "in each generation we use **np.random.choice()** to select the best parrents to create children. this function generates random indices in the given range according to their probabalities which here is their fitness which means parrent with higher fitness gets more chance to be chosed.\n",

    "**cross over** of parrents with high fitness makes better children chromosomes, we have chosen a variable p_c wich is normally 0.7 but when the results are getting worse and the fitness is decreasing p_m will be set to 0.85 to change chromosomes more.\n",
